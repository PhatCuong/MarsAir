# MarAIr Automation Test

## Project Background
MarsAir has established itself as the newest commercial spaceship operator. Founded by a group of genius engineers who left NASA a couple of years ago and growing very rapidly, MarsAir has just hired their first Sales Director, Mark.

Mark did not miss a beat – he put together a team to write their first website. Lacking an online presence when you’re selling any kind of travel these days is unacceptable!

So, since the first release has to get out the door as soon as possible, MarsAir has agreed to not worry about processing credit cards, cross-selling or even doing any kind of content management for now: it’s just trips to the Red Planet, and nothing else.

The UI needs to be attractive, but with no bells and whistles: enough to be able to sell tickets effectively, and that’s about it. It needs to look relatively similar across all commonly used browsers in use today, but doesn’t have to be pixel-perfect.

## Automation Test
### Purpose: 
To test the basic main flow to find the booking slot with the promotion code.
